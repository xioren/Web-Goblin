#### Misc:
+ this program has been tested on linux/windows/android.
+ the install script is optional and \*nix specific. it only serves to add a symlink to $HOME/.local/bin so that the program can be run from the shell with 'image-goblin' instead of 'python3 /path/to/image_goblin.py or ./image_goblin.py'.
